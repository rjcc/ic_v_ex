UNOS STAR data IC vs EX CPS
1. For the SAS and Stata programs to work properly, the data directories and file directories must be pre-set properly. Please contact me for the technical details (jeenchen@stanford.edu).
2. There may be some user-defined subroutines in the codes written by me but not uploaded here.  Please also contact me for those codes.
3. There is a plan to share these codes on Stanford Digital Depository (https://sdr.stanford.edu/) but not shared there yet as for now.
